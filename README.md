# vaultctx

The following may not happen.

## Idea

A vault cli wrapper to handle configuration and config of multiple hashicorp vaults along the following ideas.

- Ability to store vault config on disk in a secure fashion
- Ability to swap namespaces / vaults
- Use 99designs/keyring to store in Device keystore for security

## Why this might not happen

- Time
- There may be a better tool I have not found yet
- Ability to upstream config support directly
